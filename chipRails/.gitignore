# # See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# # If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# # or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
# #   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# # Ignore bundler config.
# chipRails/.bundle

# # Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
# chipRails/log/*
# chipRails/tmp/*
# !chipRails/log/.keep
# !chipRails/tmp/.keep

# # Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
# chipRails/tmp/pids/*
# !chipRails/tmp/pids/
# !chipRails/tmp/pids/.keep

# # Ignore uploaded files in development.
# chipRails/storage/*
# !chipRails/storage/.keep
# chipRails/tmp/storage/*
# !chipRails/tmp/storage/
# !chipRails/tmp/storage/.keep

# chipRails/public/assets

# # Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
# chipRails/config/master.key
