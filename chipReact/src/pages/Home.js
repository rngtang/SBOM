            <p>
                A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a formal record of all software packages and components used by a software project or machine. These components can be commercial or open-source, and in turn rely on other components themselves. This creates a series of reliances, or a chain of dependencies, that is not easily visible to the creator or user of the main project.
                An SBOM helps to solve this issue by finding all the dependencies of a project and listing them out (in our case) as a JSON file. Theyâ€™re an important part of maintaining cybersecurity, and as of an executive order issued on May 2021, are required for all software projects.
