If so, open your terminal, go to the directory your project is in, and run the following bash command with your EXACT project name, making sure to replace '/absolute/path/use/command/pwd' with the EXACT name of your project.",

Run this command in your terminal from anywhere. In this case, the name of your generated SBOM will be '/your/absolute/path'.json. To find the absolute path of your project, you can use pwd from the directory your project is in, and make sure your absolute path ends with the project you want to create an SBOM for."
